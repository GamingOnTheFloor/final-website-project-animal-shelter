You will be designing a 3-page website for your final project for this class. You will choose between 2 project briefs to work on.  You will either be creating a website for a local animal shelter or a local restaurant.

Please, find detailed instructions for the assignment here: [WEB 1400 Final Project](https://github.com/GamingOnTheFloor/final-website-project-animal-shelter/blob/master/WEB_1400_Final_Project.md)

You have the rest of the semester to work on this project, so make use of every resource available to you to create a portfolio-worthy website. 

Please, feel free to reach out to me for help as you work on the project and you can also send me a draft of your codes for feedback when you finish each phase of the project if you choose to.

I also included some svg social media icon resources for you to use here: [icons.zip](https://github.com/GamingOnTheFloor/final-website-project-animal-shelter/blob/master/icons.zip)

You can find more vector and more web friendly icons at websites such as flaticons.com, pixabay.com etc. 

Goodluck!
