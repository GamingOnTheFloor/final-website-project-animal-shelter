# __WEB 1400 Web Design & Usability Final Project__
### __Description__
In this project you will create a complete website that will include 3 pages. There are 2 project
briefs to choose from, you will either be designing a website for a local animal shelter or for a
local restaurant. See more details below:

Choose one option from the 2 project briefs provided below for your website project:

#### __Option 1__
__A local nonprofit animal shelter needs help designing a new website for their organization.__

The animal shelter website must accomplish the following goals:
* Introduce the shelter and clearly outline its purpose (sell the shelter using the home
page)
* Inform visitors of the shelter’s hours of operations, location, and contact information.
* Advertise the pets currently available for adoption by including photos and information
about each animal. Pets should be organized by category.

__OR__

#### __Option 2__
__A local restaurant needs help designing a new website to make the restaurant more visible to their customers.__

The restaurant website must accomplish the following goals:

* Introduce the restaurant and clearly outline its purpose and strengths (sell the
restaurant using the home page)
* Provide information about the restaurant menu, including photos and information
about each menu item, including prices.
* Inform visitors of the restaurant’s hours of operations, location, and contact
information.

__Note:__ You can look at existing websites for inspiration on content to include in your website.

### __Project Instructions__
This project will be split into 3 different phases where you will work through the different skills
you have learned in this class.

#### __Phase 1: Structure your website using HTML__
This is the phase where you provide a layout or structure for your website using the HTML skills
that you have learned. Your project website will include at least, an index.html (home) page,
one middle content page, and a contact page that includes a form. Make sure that you have a
consistent layout across your three pages. Each page will need to have a global navigation
menu that links to the 3 main pages on the site.

Follow the steps below in structuring your html pages:

__Step 1:__

Start each page by creating the following elements:
* A doctype declaration
* A html element
* A head element with the meta and title element enclosed (Add the title of your
page within the title element)
* A body element, where the visible content of your web pages will be placed.

__Step 2:__

The following elements must be incorporated in the body of your pages:
* header and nav repeated on each page.
* `<main>` element and at least one other semantic element like sections or article.
* div element (with class and/or id)
* UI elements: hyperlinks (links to external websites), buttons, and icons.
* list element: list of items
* image(s) (you must include a logo and an image on your website)
* form with name, email, phone inputs, and action buttons
* footer repeated on each page which includes social media icons and copyright
information

__Note:__
* Every page must have a header, nav, main and footer elements. You can then
decide on the pages you want to include the other remaining elements listed
above.
* Each page must also contain an image or logo that adds to the overall
outlook/design of the website.
* Avoid including unnecessary elements in your html code. Keep things simple.

__Choosing Images and Icons for Your Website:__

Do not use copyrighted images on any part of your website. The images and icons you
chose for your website needs to either be an original image that you produced yourself
or an image from a Creative Commons source. The following websites offer Creative
Common images that you can freely use on your website (you can also find others).

Here are some links to HTML best practices you should refer to while writing your codes:

2. [HTML Best Practices 2](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/html-best-practices/)

4. [HTML Best Practices 4](https://github.com/hail2u/html-best-practices)

#### __Phase 2: Style Your Website Using CSS and Add Responsiveness using Media Queries__
Style
In this phase, you will set up an external CSS stylesheet to style the components of your html
pages. You will include style rules relating to layout, height/width, margins/padding, color,
heading and paragraph formatting, etc. You will also create single- and multi-column layouts set
up using Flexbox or Grid CSS properties. Be sure to include a link to the stylesheet within the
`<head>` tag of each of your html page.

Before you begin, you must decide on the following design concepts:

1. __Color Scheme:__ You will need to pick out a maximum of 5 colors that you will use
throughout the site. You should not have more than 5 different colors for your site
(2 is ideal. 3 is also fine).

   Go to any of the websites below and choose a color scheme for your website

   [https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_monochromatic.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_monochromatic.asp)

2. __Typography:__ You will need to pick out at most 2 core fonts for your site. (One for the
headings and one for the rest of the text on the page.)
   * You can vary the size and weight of the fonts for the different elements on your
page, but you should not work with more than 2 core fonts for your pages.
   * You can find and choose web-acceptable fonts from this website:
https://fonts.google.com. You should also refer to the online article: The
Ultimate Collection of Google Font Pairings to help you choose two fonts that
will go well together.

3. __Properties of Layout and Border:__ You need to decide where and how the content of
your html elements will be placed and how you want the layout to look, including how
to structure the columns. It may even be very helpful to sketch out the layout you want
to implement for your page on a piece of paper before you start working. Also, decide
which elements would need borders and how you would implement those.

4. __Usability Principles:__ Your website should include best practices for usability. Consult the
class materials on web usability and decide on specific usability guidelines/principles
that you want to apply to your website.

Once you have decided upon all these relevant design concepts, then create CSS rules to
implement them on your website.

__Responsiveness__

You will also be making your website responsive using media queries in this phase. For the
website to be responsive, components such as text, images and column width should adjust in
size for different screen sizes. And nav bar can adjust to become vertical for smaller screens.

You are expected to do the following to make your website responsive:
* use relative CSS property values such as ems/rems and percentages, instead of px.
* set up media queries for a maximum breaking point device width of 768px (specifically,
create a media query for min-width of 480px and another for min-width of 768px and
add CSS rules for properties that will change for each breaking point.)

Some good resources for CSS you should refer to when writing your codes:

[Organizing your CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Organizing)

[Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox)

[Grids](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Grids)

[CSS Layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout)

[CSS Building Blocks](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks)

#### __Phase 3: Publish your Website and Write a Project Evaluation Report__
1. After completing your project, publish your website to Netlify by uploading the folder
containing your HTML and CSS files and all the assets you used to design your website.
You will be submitting the URL that will be generated by Netlify after you upload your
project. (Make sure that you have your home page is named __index.html__ page before
deploying to Netlify. This is how the server identifies your default (home) page.)
2. Then, write a report that has content organized under the following five headings:
   1. What I Learned
   2. What I Am Most Proud Of
   3. What I Would Improve on with More Time
   4. Usability Guidelines that I found to be Most Useful for My Design
   5. Explanation of Design Decisions I Made (Color, Fonts, Layouts, etc.)

__Submit the following for your final project:__
- A zipped folder containing all your project materials.
- The link that was generated by Netlify for your website.
- A word document of your project evaluation report.
